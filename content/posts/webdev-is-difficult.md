A couple months back I blogged about creating my own blog entirely from scratch *(hence the name of this blog)*... but things didn't go that well. :astonished:

There was a lot of work that had to be done and such an ambitious project would take time. Hosting, UI, backend, responsive design and everything aren't actually easy to do. Yay! You got your template working with a nice CSS file. *Now, don't mind if I*... **break your entire site by just resizing the window around** or opening it on a different screen. \
Ugh, fine! I'll just add some *fancy responsive checks* to it! Aaaaand... yeah. That solved it. But now your anchors don't show as you wanted to.

...

You get the point. Getting everything done it's not an overnight task. It could be stressful to do all at once and take responsability of everything you have. \
Think of hosting your page. It sure is nice to learn about **Docker**, **Nginx** and even buying your own **Raspberry Pi** to host everything! But what about if you get traffic-doomed with [34M requests in just 72h](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-won-free-load-testing)? Will your site survive all the traffic or would just, straight up die? \
That actually sounds like a *really fun situation* to analyze and solve, but **everything! takes! time!** \
You're not going to get your site working in a matter seconds, and will probably be hard if you haven't stumbled with that kind of things once in your life.

In my [last post](https://grbenjamin.github.io/posts/building-a-backend/) we talked a bit about the backend side of the project. How I wanted my page to work and how I was putting **Rust** into practice. \
Sure, a backend is good to have in your website to handle all the parts of it, but is it *really* needed? Do I *really* have to deploy a whole of it just to have nice little URLs such as `/posts/`? Meh, no. There is a lot of stuff going on that needs to be done to have everything working in such a short period of time for just one person[^1]. 

[^1]: Well, actually, nobody is rushing me up, but I certainly want to blog as soon as possible. ^.^

Don't get me wrong. Doing that stuff was **100% worth it**, I learned the steps involved in setting up everything from the ground up, to having a *fun* way of writing posts... to having such URLs I wanted (on a whim). In the end, though, that is the purpose of this blog, to have a constant *try-fail-learn* attitude with pretty much every topic I want to learn.
